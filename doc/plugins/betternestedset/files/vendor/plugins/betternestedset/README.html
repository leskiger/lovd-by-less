      <h1>Better nested set</h1>
<p>
This plugin provides an enhanced acts_as_nested_set mixin for ActiveRecord,
the object-relational mapping layer of the framework Ruby on Rails. The
original nested set in Rails lacks many important features, such as moving
branches within a tree.
</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<pre>
  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/betternestedset/trunk
</pre>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>
A nested set is a smart way to implement an <em>ordered</em> tree that
allows for fast, non-recursive queries. For example, you can fetch all
descendants of a node in a single query, no matter how deep the tree. The
drawback is that insertions/moves/deletes require complex SQL, but that is
handled behind the curtains by this plugin!
</p>
<p>
Nested sets are appropriate for ordered trees (e.g. menus, commercial
categories) and big trees that must be queried efficiently (e.g. threaded
posts).
</p>
<p>
See <a
href="http://www.dbmsmag.com/9603d06.html">www.dbmsmag.com/9603d06.html</a>
for nested sets theory, and a tutorial here: <a
href="http://threebit.net/tutorials/nestedset/tutorial1.html">threebit.net/tutorials/nestedset/tutorial1.html</a>
</p>
<h2>Small nested set theory reminder</h2>
<p>
An easy way to visualize how a nested set works is to think of a parent
entity surrounding all of its children, and its parent surrounding it, etc.
So this tree:
</p>
<pre>
  root
    |_ Child 1
      |_ Child 1.1
      |_ Child 1.2
    |_ Child 2
      |_ Child 2.1
      |_ Child 2.2
</pre>
<p>
Could be visualized like this:
</p>
<pre>
    ___________________________________________________________________
   |  Root                                                             |
   |    ____________________________    ____________________________   |
   |   |  Child 1                  |   |  Child 2                  |   |
   |   |   __________   _________  |   |   __________   _________  |   |
   |   |  |  C 1.1  |  |  C 1.2 |  |   |  |  C 2.1  |  |  C 2.2 |  |   |
   1   2  3_________4  5________6  7   8  9_________10 11_______12 13  14
   |   |___________________________|   |___________________________|   |
   |___________________________________________________________________|
</pre>
<p>
The numbers represent the left and right boundaries. The table then might
look like this:
</p>
<pre>
   id | parent_id | lft  | rgt  | data
    1 |           |    1 |   14 | root
    2 |         1 |    2 |    7 | Child 1
    3 |         2 |    3 |    4 | Child 1.1
    4 |         2 |    5 |    6 | Child 1.2
    5 |         1 |    8 |   13 | Child 2
    6 |         5 |    9 |   10 | Child 2.1
    7 |         5 |   11 |   12 | Child 2.2
</pre>
<p>
To get all children of an entry <tt>parent</tt>, you
</p>
<pre>
    SELECT * WHERE lft IS BETWEEN parent.lft AND parent.rgt
</pre>
<p>
To get the number of children, it&#8216;s
</p>
<pre>
    (right - left - 1)/2
</pre>
<p>
To get a node and all its ancestors going back to the root, you
</p>
<pre>
    SELECT * WHERE node.lft IS BETWEEN lft AND rgt
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, queries that would be recursive and prohibitively slow on
ordinary trees are suddenly quite fast. Nifty, isn&#8216;t it? There are
instance methods for each of the above, plus many others.
</p>
<h1>API</h1>
<p>
Method names are mostly the same as in acts_as_tree, to make replacment
from one by another easier, except for object creation:
</p>
<p>
in acts_as_tree:
</p>
<pre>
  my_item.children.create(:name =&gt; &quot;child1&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
in acts_as_nested_set:
</p>
<pre>
  # adds a new item at the &quot;end&quot; of the tree, i.e. with child.left = max(tree.right) + 1
  child = MyClass.create(:name =&gt; &quot;child1&quot;)
  # now move the item to its desired location
  child.move_to_child_of my_item
</pre>
<p>
You can use:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>move_to_child_of</tt>

</li>
<li><tt>move_to_right_of</tt>

</li>
<li><tt>move_to_left_of</tt>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
and pass them an id or an object.
</p>
<p>
Other instance methods added by this plugin include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>root</tt> - root item of the tree (the one that has a nil parent)

</li>
<li><tt>roots</tt> - root items, in case of multiple roots (the ones that have
a nil parent)

</li>
<li><tt>level</tt> - number indicating the level, a root being level 0

</li>
<li><tt>ancestors</tt> - array of all parents, with root as first item

</li>
<li><tt>self_and_ancestors</tt> - array of all parents and self

</li>
<li><tt>siblings</tt> - array of all siblings (items sharing the same parent)

</li>
<li><tt>self_and_siblings</tt> - array of itself and all siblings

</li>
<li><tt>children_count</tt> - count of all nested children

</li>
<li><tt>children</tt> - array of all immediate children

</li>
<li><tt>all_children</tt> - array of all children and nested children

</li>
<li><tt>full_set</tt> - array of itself and all children and nested children

</li>
<li><tt>leaves</tt> - array of the children of this node who do not have
children

</li>
<li><tt>leaves_count</tt> - the number of leaves

</li>
<li><tt>check_subtree</tt> - check the left/right indexes of this node and all
descendants

</li>
<li><tt>check_full_tree</tt> - check the whole tree this node belongs to

</li>
<li><tt>renumber_full_tree</tt> - recreate the left/right indexes for the whole
tree

</li>
</ul>
<p>
These should not be of interest, unless you want to write
schema-independent SQL:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>left_col_name</tt> - name of the left column passed on the declaration
line

</li>
<li><tt>right_col_name</tt> - name of the right column passed on the
declaration line

</li>
<li><tt>parent_col_name</tt> - name of the parent column passed on the
declaration line

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please see the generated RDoc files in doc/ for the full API (run
&#8216;rake rdoc&#8217; if they need to be created).
</p>
<h2>Concurrency and callbacks</h2>
<p>
ActiveRecord does not yet provide a way to treat columns as read-only,
which causes problems for nested sets and other things (<a
href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/6896">dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/6896</a>).
As a workaround, we have overridden ActiveRecord::Base#update to prevent it
from writing to the left/right columns. This protects the left/right values
from corruption under concurrent usage, but it breaks the update-related
callbacks (before_update and friends). If you need the callbacks and
aren&#8216;t worried about concurrency, you can comment out the update
method and the two methods below it (all at the very bottom of
better_nested_set.rb).
</p>
<p>
If this situation bugs you as much as it does us, leave a comment on the
above ticket asking the core team to please apply the patch soon.
</p>
<h2>Scopes and roots</h2>
<p>
Scope separates trees from each other, and roots are nodes without a
parent. The complication is that a tree can have multiple
(&quot;virtual&quot;) roots.
</p>
<p>
Virtual roots?! In some situations, such as a menu, the root of the tree is
ignored, and becomes a nuisance to the programmer. In that case it makes
sense to remove the root, turning each of its children into a
&#8216;virtual root&#8217;. These virtual roots are still members of the
same tree, sharing a single continuous left/right index.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8216;s an example that demonstrates scopes, roots and virtual roots:
</p>
<pre>
  class Set &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_nested_set :scope =&gt; :tree_id
  end

  # This will create two trees, each with a single (real) root.
  a = Set.create(:tree_id =&gt; 1)
  b = Set.create(:tree_id =&gt; 2)

  # This will add a second root to tree #2, so it will have two (virtual) roots.
  # New objects are by default created as virtual roots at the right side of the tree.
  c = Set.create(:tree_id =&gt; 2)  # c.lft is 3, c.rgt is 4 -- the lft/rgt values are contiguous between the two roots

  # When we move c to be a child of b, tree #2 will have a single (real) root again.
  c.move_to_child_of(b)

  # The table would now look like this:
  id | parent_id | tree_id | lft | rgt | data
   1 |      NULL |       1 |   1 |   2 | a
   2 |      NULL |       2 |   1 |   4 | b
   3 |         2 |       2 |   2 |   3 | c
</pre>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>
Don&#8216;t name your left and right columns &#8216;left&#8217; and
&#8216;right&#8217;, since most databases reserve these words. Use
something like &#8216;lft&#8217; and &#8216;rgt&#8217; instead.
</p>
<p>
If you have a choice between multiple separate trees or one large tree with
multiple roots, separate trees will offer better performance when altering
tree structure (inserts/moves/deletes).
</p>
<h1>Where to find better_nested_set</h1>
<p>
This plugin is provided by Jean-Christophe Michel from Symétrie, and the
home page is:
</p>
<pre>
  http://opensource.symetrie.com/trac/better_nested_set/
</pre>
<h1>What databases?</h1>
<p>
The code has so far been tested on MySQL 5, SQLite3 and PostgreSQL 8, but
is thought to work on others. Databases featuring transactions will help
protect the left/right indexes from corruption during concurrent usage.
</p>
<h1>Compatibility</h1>
<p>
Future versions of this code will break compatibility with the original
acts_as_nested_set, but this version is intended to be (almost completely)
compatible. Differences include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>New records automatically have their left/right values set to place them at
the far right of the tree.

</li>
<li>Very minor changes to the deprecated method root?.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>Running the unit tests</h1>
<p>
1) Set up a test database as specified in database.yml. Example for MySQL:
</p>
<pre>
    create database acts_as_nested_set_plugin_test;
    grant all on acts_as_nested_set_plugin_test.* to 'rails'@'localhost' identified by '';
</pre>
<p>
2) The tests must be run with the plugin installed in a Rails project, so
do that if you haven&#8216;t already.
</p>
<p>
3) Run &#8216;rake test_mysql&#8217; (or test_sqlite3 or test_postgresql)
in plugins/betternestedset. The default rake task attempts to use all three
adapters.
